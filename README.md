Copilot Agent Test - Duel Scripts

Take 4: Multiple agents:
- Use design phase + TDD model.
- CRC driven design.
- Use multiple agents to continuously correct each other.
- Let agents be more autonomous - implement all tests for iteration without pausing.
- Minimal refactoring intervention - allow agents to correct each other. Manually control design only at CRC level.
