# Fight History

As fighters fight, they create fight history, and each round is added into it. The history records who strikes what, and with what weapon, what parry attempts are made, and whether the strike was successfully parried, and whether a critical hit occured, and what damage was dealt.

Additionally, the whole history can be "printed out" in a way that it is structured into rounds, including the remaining health of each fighter at the end of the round. If either fighter died in that round, then this fact is included as well.

## Thick Description

Every duel tells a story. As two fighters clash in the Arena, each exchange leaves its mark—not just on the fighters' bodies, but in the memory of the fight itself. The Fight History is that memory: a living chronicle that grows with each passing round, capturing the ebb and flow of combat in faithful detail.

### The Chronicle Takes Shape

Consider Marcus and Helena, circling each other in the Arena. Helena decides to strike at Marcus's head with her longsword while parrying her own torso. Marcus, reading her aggressive stance, aims for her legs while protecting his head. The exchange unfolds—Helena's blade crashes toward Marcus's unguarded head, while Marcus's strike finds Helena's legs exposed. In this single moment, the History captures both strikes landing: Helena struck Marcus's head with longsword, dealing 15 damage; Marcus struck Helena's legs with shortsword, dealing 8 damage. Neither parry found its mark this time.

The History doesn't merely record that damage was dealt; it preserves the full texture of the moment. It knows that Helena chose to strike head, that she parried torso, that her strike landed on an unparried body part. It knows Marcus's decision to aim low, his choice to guard high, and the outcome of that gamble. (This suggests History might receive a complete account of each exchange from the Arena or Exchange—noting who struck what, who parried where, and what resulted.)

### A Parry's Echo

Two rounds later, Marcus anticipates Helena's pattern. She's favored head strikes, so he parries head this round while striking at her torso. Helena, true to form, swings for his head—but this time the blade meets Marcus's guard. The History records this deflection: Helena struck at Marcus's head, parried successfully, no damage. Meanwhile, Helena had left her torso exposed, guessing Marcus would target her legs again. Her gamble fails—Marcus's blade finds her torso, dealing 12 damage with a critical hit. The History captures this too: the critical hit occurred, the damage was amplified, the strike landed true.

What makes this round memorable is the contrast: one strike deflected into nothing, the other landing with devastating precision. A reader of the History would see both outcomes side by side, understanding not just what happened, but how the fighters' choices intersected.

### Reading the Chronicle

When the fight concludes—or when anyone wishes to understand its arc—the History can describe itself round by round. Each round's account stands as a complete vignette: what strikes were attempted, which body parts were targeted, which parries were raised, whether strikes landed or were deflected, whether critical hits flared, and what damage was ultimately dealt. At the end of each round's account, the History reports both fighters' remaining health. This matters because it shows the fight's trajectory—was it a slow grinding attrition, or did one devastating round turn the tide?

Imagine printing the History of a three-round bout. Round 1 might show both fighters landing blows, ending with Marcus at 85 HP and Helena at 92 HP. Round 2 could show Marcus's successful parry and critical counter, leaving him at 70 HP and Helena at 65 HP. Round 3, perhaps, ends the duel: Helena lands a crushing head strike for 20 damage while Marcus's attack is parried—Marcus falls to 50 HP, but Helena's torso takes a critical 25-damage hit from a strike that slipped past her guard, dropping her to 40 HP. They fight on.

But consider if Round 4 proves fatal. Helena, at 40 HP, takes another 45 damage from a critical head strike. Her HP drops to zero—or below. The History records this not merely as a damage number, but as a death. When describing Round 4, it would note: Helena struck at legs, 8 damage dealt; Marcus struck at head, critical hit, 45 damage dealt; Helena died. The finality is explicit. (This implies the History knows when a fighter has died, perhaps by checking if their HP has reached zero after damage is applied, or by being told explicitly that the fight has ended in death.)

### The Shape of Memory

The History accumulates round by round, each exchange appended to those before. It does not forget earlier rounds when new ones occur—the full arc of combat remains accessible. Whether the fight lasts two rounds or twenty, the History preserves each moment with equal fidelity.

When asked to describe itself, the History presents its contents in structured form: rounds appear in order, each round containing the complete account of both fighters' actions and outcomes, followed by their health status, followed by death if it occurred. This structure allows anyone—a spectator, a Script analyzing past fights, a test verifying game logic—to walk through the fight moment by moment and understand exactly what transpired.

The History doesn't interpret or judge. It simply remembers: the choices made, the outcomes that followed, the damage dealt, the parries that held, the critical hits that changed everything, and ultimately, who stood and who fell.
