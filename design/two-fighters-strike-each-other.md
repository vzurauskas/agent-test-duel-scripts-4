Two fighters enter Arena and prepare to fight each other. Aragorn strikes Boromir's head, while parrying his torso. At the same time, Borimir strikes Aragorn's legs, while parrying his own legs.

When two fighters step into the Arena, they face each other knowing that every moment of the duel will unfold in perfect simultaneity. Neither fighter sees what the other chooses before committing to their own action. Both must decide where to strike and what to parry in the same breath.

This simultaneity matters because it transforms each turn from a simple exchange into a gamble of predictions and counter-predictions. Aragorn, wielding his sword, must guess: will Boromir protect his head, his torso, or his legs? Meanwhile, Boromir faces the same uncertainty about where Aragorn's blade will fall.

Consider this first exchange: Aragorn commits to a strike aimed at Boromir's head—the most damaging target if it lands—while simultaneously raising his guard to parry any incoming blow to his own torso. At the exact same instant, Boromir chooses to strike low at Aragorn's legs while protecting his own legs. 

The parry is a perfect defense but narrow. When a fighter parries their head, only a strike to the head is deflected—nothing else. This means that Boromir's decision to parry his legs, while prudent if Aragorn had struck there, left his head completely exposed to Aragorn's actual attack. The strike landed, and Boromir's hit points decreased accordingly.

Each body part represents a different wager. The head promises the highest damage but is often the most guarded. The torso offers moderate damage with moderate risk. The legs deal the least harm but might catch an opponent who expects a more aggressive strike. In that first exchange, Aragorn wagered that Boromir would not protect his head, and he was right.

(This matters because the game is about anticipating the opponent's script—their pattern of thought—not reacting to visible telegraphs. Every decision is blind until revealed.)

Let's reconsider: when fighters parry, they protect one of *their own* body parts from an incoming strike. So if Aragorn parries his head, he blocks any strike targeting his head. If Boromir strikes Aragorn's head while Aragorn is parrying his head, the strike is deflected. But if Boromir strikes Aragorn's torso while Aragorn is parrying his head, the strike lands.

One more scenario to illuminate the texture of these exchanges: imagine Boromir becomes desperate. He strikes Aragorn's head (maximum damage) while parrying his own head (maximum defense). Aragorn, sensing Boromir's aggression, also strikes head and parries head. No damage occurs. The fighters have mirrored each other perfectly, and the turn passes without consequence.
