Fighters use weapons to strike each other. Different weapons have different damage multipliers. Total damage from a normal (non-critical) hit (when not parried) is weapon damage multiplier * body part base damage multiplier. Weapons also have a critical hit chance, which, if happens, multiplies the damage additionally with the weapon's critical hit multiplier.

Even unarmed combat uses weapons, technically, in which case these weapons would be fists.

## Thick Description

A weapon is an extension of the fighter's intent—the means by which a strike translates into harm. When Greta the Grim hefts her war hammer and swings at her opponent's torso, it is the hammer that determines how devastating that blow will be. The torso has its own vulnerability (a base damage of 15), but the hammer amplifies this: its damage multiplier of 2.0 transforms the blow into 30 points of punishment. A dagger-wielding rogue striking the same spot would deal less—perhaps only 12 points with a 0.8 multiplier—but the dagger is quicker and more likely to find a gap in defenses.

This matters because damage in a duel is a collaboration between weapon and target. The body part knows its own vulnerability; the weapon knows its own brutality. When a strike lands (that is, when the body part is unparried), the body part asks the weapon how much to multiply its base damage. The weapon answers honestly, and together they determine the hurt inflicted on the defender. (This suggests the weapon has a responsibility: to report its damage multiplier when asked, and the body part must collaborate with the weapon to calculate final damage.)

### The Lucky Strike

Sometimes fortune favors the bold. Weapons carry with them the possibility of a critical hit—a moment of perfect timing, a stroke of devastating luck. Consider Marcus the Swift, whose rapier has a critical hit chance of 0.15 (15%). Most of his thrusts land true but unremarkably. But once in a while—roughly one strike in seven—the blade finds a seam in armor, a nerve cluster, an artery. When this happens, the weapon's critical multiplier (say, 2.5 for the rapier) compounds the damage further.

Picture the sequence: Marcus targets Greta's head. His rapier has a damage multiplier of 1.2. The head's base damage is 25. A normal hit would deal 30 points (1.2 × 25). But fortune smiles—the weapon determines this is a critical hit. Now the damage becomes 75 points (1.2 × 25 × 2.5). Greta staggers. The crowd roars.

The weapon decides whether a critical hit occurs. It knows its own critical chance and its critical multiplier. When the strike lands on an unparried body part, the weapon is consulted: was this strike critical? The weapon makes this determination (perhaps by chance, perhaps by consulting its nature), and if so, provides the additional multiplier. (This is a second responsibility for the weapon: to determine if a strike is critical and, if so, to apply its critical multiplier.)

### The Bare-Knuckle Brawl

Not all fighters carry steel. When two brawlers face off without blades, they still wield weapons—their fists. A fist is modest: perhaps a damage multiplier of 0.5 and a critical chance of 0.05 with a critical multiplier of 1.5. When Brock the Brawler throws a punch at his opponent's legs, the calculation is the same: leg base damage (10) × fist multiplier (0.5) = 5 points. A critical punch to the head might reach 18.75 points (25 × 0.5 × 1.5), but such fortune is rare.

This uniformity matters. The system does not care whether the fighter grips a greatsword or clenches bare knuckles—both are weapons, both know their multipliers and critical properties, both collaborate with body parts when strikes land. The fighter simply wields whatever weapon they have, and the weapon speaks for itself.

### An Illustrative Exchange

Greta (war hammer: damage 2.0, crit chance 0.10, crit multiplier 2.0) faces Marcus (rapier: damage 1.2, crit chance 0.15, crit multiplier 2.5). Both strike simultaneously:

- Greta swings at Marcus's torso. Marcus did not parry his torso. Greta's hammer is asked: "How much damage?" The hammer replies: "2.0 times the base." The torso's base is 15, so 30 damage. The hammer is asked: "Was this critical?" It considers its 10% chance and says no. Marcus takes 30 damage.

- Marcus thrusts at Greta's head. Greta parried her head. The strike lands on a parried body part—no damage is dealt, and the weapon is never consulted. The parry absorbs everything.

Next exchange: both strike again. This time Marcus aims for Greta's legs (unparried). The rapier deals 12 damage (1.2 × 10). The rapier checks for a critical—luck is with Marcus, and it triggers. The damage becomes 30 (12 × 2.5). Greta winces.

### Observable Outcomes

After any exchange, the fight history records not just that damage occurred, but how much. When a fighter describes themselves, their remaining hit points reflect the cumulative toll of weapons wielded against them. The specific weapon used in each strike, and whether that strike was critical, could be part of the exchange's history—allowing observers (and scripts making future decisions) to learn from past events. (This suggests that strikes or their outcomes might need to remember which weapon was used and whether a critical occurred, so the history remains informative.)
